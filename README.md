The python scripy menu.py is a simple script to collect a users order from a dictionary-based menu variable.

This menu is defined at the head of the file.

When executed, the file first prompts the user for the category of food they would like to order (The top-level list of keys in the menu). After selection, the keys of the items in that category are listed. The user is then prompted to select an item and a quantity of that item.

After completing an individual item order, the user is prompted if they would like to continue ordering. If yes, the loop continues, if not a receipt and order total are printed.
